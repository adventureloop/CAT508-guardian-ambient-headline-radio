Conversion of the Guardian ambient radio station to Javascript
==============================================================

An attempt to make javascript play ambient music and speak the latest Guardian headlines.

Only tested in Chrome & Firefox
Doesn't seem to work in Safari, not tested in IE

Running here: http://revdancatt.github.com/GuardianAmbientHeadlineRadio

The page polls the Guardian Content API for the latest headlines, if it sees one it hasn't spotted before then it "announces" it and changes the background image.

NOTES
