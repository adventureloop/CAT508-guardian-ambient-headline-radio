Conversion of the Guardian ambient radio station to Javascript
==============================================================

An attempt to make javascript play ambient music and speak the latest Guardian headlines.

Only tested in Chrome (obviously)

For the moment I just want the background image.

You can read notes about the image stuff here: http://revdancatt.com/2012/03/31/the-pxl-effect-with-javascript-and-canvas-and-maths/

This pulls the latest stories from the Guardian, finds one we haven't seen before that has a thumbnail, loads in the thumbnail to a hidden canvas object and then does some stupid maths to work out all the triangle stuff.

Next
----

1. add the headline
2. add the headline being spoken
3. add the music
4. stuff
