Conversion of the Guardian ambient radio station to Javascript
==============================================================

An attempt to make javascript play ambient music and speak the latest Guardian headlines.

Only tested in Chrome (obviously)

Running here: http://revdancatt.github.com/GuardianAmbientHeadlineRadio

NOTE
----

Still not *really* using ambient music yet

But
---

For the moment I just want the background image.

You can read notes about the image stuff here: http://revdancatt.com/2012/03/31/the-pxl-effect-with-javascript-and-canvas-and-maths/

This pulls the latest stories from the Guardian, finds one we haven't seen before that has a thumbnail, loads in the thumbnail to a hidden canvas object and then does some stupid maths to work out all the triangle stuff.

Done
----

1. Add tiny headline at the bottom just to aplease people who wanted to be able to click thru from the image to the story
2. Added first pass at the text-to-speech
3. Added some music, but the WRONG KIND!

Next
----

1. add the headline
2. add the music
3. stuff
